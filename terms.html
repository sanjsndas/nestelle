                        Many of our services require ongoing maintenance to preserve the intended results. We may provide maintenance recommendations, but the client is ultimately responsible for following these guidelines. We are not responsible for deterioration of results caused by failure to perform recommended maintenance. Additional services may be required if maintenance recommendations are not followed.
