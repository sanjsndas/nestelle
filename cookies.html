                        When you first visit our website, you'll see a cookie consent banner that allows you to accept or decline non-essential cookies. Your consent preferences will be stored in a cookie so we can remember your choices on subsequent visits. You can change your cookie preferences at any time through our cookie preference center. Essential cookies don't require consent as they're necessary for basic website functionality.

                        Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through browser settings. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our website may become inaccessible or not function properly. The methods for managing cookies vary by browser and device. You can usually find these settings in the 'Options' or 'Preferences' menu of your browser. Popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari provide detailed cookie management options.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites, you can install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. This add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript from sharing information with Google Analytics about your visit activity. For other analytics services we use, you'll need to check their respective opt-out mechanisms. Some services provide opt-out cookies that you can set to prevent tracking. Remember that if you clear your cookies, you may need to reset these opt-out preferences.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        Many advertising networks allow you to opt out of targeted advertising. In the US, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt-out page or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) opt-out page. In Europe, you can visit the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) opt-out page. These opt-outs are often cookie-based and will only work for the specific browser you're using when you set them. You'll need to repeat the opt-out process for each browser and device you use to access our site.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">
                        On mobile devices, you may have additional options to control how cookies and other tracking technologies are used. Both iOS and Android provide settings to limit ad tracking. These settings affect how advertisers use cookies and other tracking methods to serve you targeted ads. However, they don't necessarily block all tracking cookies. For comprehensive cookie control on mobile devices, you may need to use browser settings in addition to device settings. Some mobile browsers also offer private browsing modes that limit cookie storage and tracking.
